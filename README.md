# Howdy
I'm Skyy, or SkyyWasTaken if you prefer (no, it doesn't have anything to do with DreamWasTaken). I mostly write Minecraft Forge mods and Spigot plugins but I do a bit of everything on the side.

I have experience in Java, Kotlin, C#, Lua, and TI-84 BASIC.

If you'd like me to write something, I'm more than open! The more experience, the better.

If you need to get in touch with me, feel free to message me on Discord! I'm Ian#0674
